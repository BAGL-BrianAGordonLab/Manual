											<h2>Life in BAGL</h2>
										</header>

										<section>
											<h3>Time Management</h3>
											<p>Effective time management is crucial in our lab to ensure productivity and maintain a healthy work-life balance. We emphasize the importance of prioritization, setting realistic goals, and managing deadlines. By utilizing efficient planning strategies and organizational tools, lab members can optimize their time and optimize their productivity. We encourage open communication to address any time management challenges and offer resources and support to help individuals develop effective time management skills. Ultimately, by effectively managing our time, we can achieve our research goals while maintaining a positive and sustainable work environment.</p>

											<h3>Communication</h3>
											<p>Clear and effective communication is a cornerstone of our lab's success. We value open dialogue, active listening, and respect for diverse perspectives. Regular team meetings, email updates, and collaborative platforms facilitate seamless information sharing and foster a supportive work environment. We encourage transparent and timely communication to ensure everyone is aligned on project goals, milestones, and any potential challenges. By promoting a culture of effective communication, we enhance collaboration, productivity, and the overall success of our lab.</p>

											<h3>Social Etiquette</h3>
											<p>In our lab, we not only value effective communication within our team but also recognize the importance of professional conduct in conference environments. We encourage lab members to represent themselves and our research with professionalism and respect when attending conferences or scientific meetings. This includes actively engaging in presentations, asking thoughtful questions, and providing constructive feedback to fellow researchers. We also promote networking and building connections with peers and experts in the field. By upholding high standards of behavior and etiquette in conference settings, we enhance our professional reputation and contribute to the broader scientific community.</p>

											<h3>Maintaining Health</h3>
											<p>We understand the significance of maintaining a healthy work-life balance. We value the well-being and personal fulfillment of our lab members. We encourage everyone to prioritize self-care, manage their workload effectively, and set boundaries to ensure a balance between work and personal life. We believe that taking time for oneself, pursuing hobbies, spending quality time with loved ones, and engaging in activities outside of work contribute to overall productivity and satisfaction. By fostering a supportive and flexible environment, we aim to help our lab members achieve a sustainable work-life balance that promotes both personal happiness and professional growth.</p>

											<h3>Career Development</h3>
											<p>Career development and mentoring are key aspects of our lab culture. We prioritize supporting postdocs, graduate students, and other lab members in their professional growth. Through mentorship, guidance, and access to relevant resources, we aim to empower individuals to explore their career options, develop necessary skills, and make informed decisions about their future paths. We believe that investing in career development and fostering mentor-mentee relationships contribute to the success and satisfaction of our lab members.</p>
											
											<h3>Funding</h3>
											<p>Brian will make every effort to secure grants and funding to support individuals for a couple of years. However, funding availability is competitive and unpredictable. Lab members are encouraged to actively pursue external funding opportunities, and the PI will provide guidance and mentorship throughout the application process. Taking an active role in seeking funding enhances skills and opens doors for future career opportunities. 
												The lab values and supports the career growth of its members and strives to provide resources to advance research and professional aspirations.
											</p>	

											<h3>Code of Conduct</h3>
											<p>We strive to create an inclusive, collaborative, and respectful environment where all members can thrive. 
												We embrace diverse perspectives and foster an atmosphere of open communication. 
												We value integrity and uphold ethical standards for the responsible use of resources and data. 
												Harassment, discrimination, and any form of misconduct will not be tolerated. 
												We work together as a team, supporting and uplifting one another, and recognizing the contributions of all members. 
												By adhering to this code of conduct, we create a positive and enriching experience for everyone in our lab and university community. 
												More information regarding Washington University’s code of conduct can be found <a href="https://bpb-us-w2.wpmucdn.com/sites.wustl.edu/dist/2/3602/files/2023/03/Final-UCO-2024-CoC-Website-03-30-2023.pdf" target="_blank">here</a>.
