												<h3>Career Development and Individual Mentoring Plans</h3>

													Our goal is to foster a supportive and collaborative environment that empowers individuals to reach their full potential and achieve their career aspirations.
										  		</p>

												<h3>Graduate Students</h3>
												<p>As a member of our lab, it is essential that you take ownership of your degree and academic journey by staying proactive and well-informed about program and university deadlines, requirements, and any other pertinent information. 
													We are here to support and guide you along the way, but ultimately, the responsibility for staying on top of your academic obligations lies with you. 
													Together, we can create a productive and rewarding experience during your time in our lab.
												</p>

												<h3>Postdoctoral Research Associates</h3>
												<p>As a postdoctoral researcher in our lab, it is crucial that you take charge of your professional development and career advancement by staying informed about funding opportunities, publication deadlines, conference presentations, and any other professional commitments. 
													While we are here to provide guidance and support, the responsibility for managing your postdoctoral journey lies with you. 
													Together, we can create a stimulating and impactful research environment that fosters your professional growth and success.
												</p>

												<h3>Performance and Evaluation </h3>
												<p>Regular evaluations allow us to recognize your achievements and address any challenges by setting clear expectations and providing constructive feedback.
													Our lab values performance and ensures you receive personalized feedback at crucial intervals: 1, 3, and 5 months for newcomers, and annually thereafter. 
													Evaluation forms can be found <a href="https://wustl.app.box.com/folder/195664975610">here</a>.

												<h3>Teaching and Mentorship Opportunities</h3>
												<p>Explore the enriching realm of teaching and mentorship in our lab. 
													If you're interested, you can contribute to the development of a seminar series, mentor an undergraduate researcher during fall, spring, or summer, or teach a masters level course through University College. 
													Your involvement nurtures both scientific progress and the development of emerging talents.
												</p>
												
												<h3>Conferences and Symposia</h3>
												<p>Engagement in conferences and symposia is a crucial component of our lab's commitment to your professional development as these events offer invaluable opportunities to showcase your research, network with peers and experts, and stay updated on the latest advancements in our field. 
													Whether you're presenting your work, attending talks, or participating in discussions, these experiences can enhance your skills, broaden your perspectives, and contribute to your growth as a researcher. 
													Our lab proudly supports your participation in such events, recognizing their role in fostering your academic journey. 
												</p>

												<h3>Funding</h3>
												<p>Brian will make every effort to secure grants and funding to support individuals for a couple of years; however, funding availability is competitive and unpredictable. 
													Lab members are encouraged to actively pursue external funding opportunities, and Brian will provide guidance and mentorship throughout the application process. 
													Taking an active role in seeking funding enhances skills and opens doors for future career opportunities. 
												</p>	
													
												<h3>Publications</h3>
												<p>PhD students and postdocs in our lab are encouraged to actively engage in impactful research and contribute to the advancement of knowledge in our field. 
													While we understand that research timelines can vary, a proactive approach towards publication is essential. 
													Our lab provides the necessary support and resources to help you navigate the publishing process and achieve success in showcasing your research to the broader scientific community.
