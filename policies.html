                                                    Leave durations and benefits vary based on the type of leave and individual circumstances.<br>

												<h3>Wage and Salary</h3>
												<p>

												</p>

												<h3>Consensual Relationships</h3>
												<p>When a consensual romantic, dating, or sexual relationship involves one partner holding a position of academic or professional authority over the other partner within the University context, potential issues like favoritism, breaches of trust, and conflicts of interest can arise. 
													This situation may also raise doubts about the nature of the relationship's consent. 
													To address these concerns, the University mandates that partners in such relationships where one partner currently holds a position of authority must promptly report it to their supervisor, department chair, or dean. 
													Arrangements will then be made to either eliminate the authority or mitigate the associated risks. 
													This policy covers situations where a partner's authority extends to matters such as employment, evaluation, recommendation, funding, and more, and applies even when a faculty member and graduate student share the same department or unit.<br><br>
											
													<em>Undergraduate Students</em><br>
													The University prohibits consensual relationships between undergraduate students and faculty members, and between undergraduate students and employees in administrative or staff roles having broad authority over undergraduate students 
													(e.g., deans and other senior administrators, coaches, academic advisors), regardless of whether the faculty or employee holds a specific position of academic or professional authority with respect to the student.<br><br>

													<em>Noncompliance with Policy</em><br>
													Violation of this policy may result in a range of remedial and disciplinary actions, including but not limited to mandatory training or counseling, reprimand, probation, suspension, loss of privileges, demotion, expulsion, dismissal or termination.<br><br>

													<em>Faculty Rights</em><br>
													Nothing in this policy is intended to abridge the rights of faculty as outlined in the Washington University Policy on Academic Freedom, Responsibility, and Tenure.
